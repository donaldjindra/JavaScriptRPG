# JavaScriptRPG

This is a game I started building about three weeks ago using JavaScript and some CSS animations.  It's my first attempt at doing something like this.  The idea was just to develop a simple turn based RPG.  There's not much to it yet, but I have a lot of features I plan on figuring out how to add over the new several weeks.

Currently I have three playable classes.  There are also three enemies, one of which is chosen at random. Right now basically the player is given a choice of attacking an enemy.  If they decline, the player is attacked anyway.  I have one full encounter done, with the code looping them back into that encounter if they survive.  I added additional code to keep the player playing until they die, as well as a scoring system.

My next plans include adding some basic sound effects.  Also want to add more attack choices for the player.  Additional attacks for the enemy will follow after that.  I also want to add more stats, like armor and attack speed, modifiers for the damage, and other things.
